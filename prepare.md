**Slide 1: Title Slide ("TradeScope – Smarter Investment Decision")**

"Good afternoon, everyone. We are "grass station" team. My name is Shen Hongshan, and...
Let's talk about a problem many of us might have faced or seen: the struggle of a new generation of investors in a complex, overwhelming market. 

we are proud to introduce **TradeScope** – an AI-driven platform designed not just to provide data, 
but to deliver **smarter investment decisions**."

**Slide 2: The Problem – Young Investors Are Struggling**

"Young investors today are battling three core challenges:
First, **Information Overload**. They are flooded with news, data, and opinions, but lack the tools to filter what truly matters.
Second, **Tool Fragmentation**. Their resources are scattered across different apps and platforms, preventing a **unified view** of their investments.
And third, a critical **Knowledge Gap**. Without proper guidance, they often follow the crowd or act on emotion."

"The result? Painful losses. **86%** of young investors lost over 20% in the last bear market. **72%** admit they don't know when to buy or sell. 

**Slide 3: Our Solution**

"So, how does TradeScope change this? We shift  **from information dumping to intelligent insights**.

Our platform answers three critical questions for every young investor:
**One: 'What Happened?'** through real-time market monitoring
**Two: 'Why Does It Matter?'** where our AI explains the underlying reasons.
And **Three: 'How Should I Act?'** with personalized guidance.

We don't just show data; we provide **context, education, and direction.**
